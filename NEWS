    liblibrets-<vsversion>-<flags>-<version>.lib where:
        <vsversion> is the compiler version;
        <flags> is "s" to indicate statically linked and
                "d" indicates that the library has debug code;
        <version> is the libRETS version number.
    For example:
        liblibrets-vs2008-sd-1.5.0b1.lib

    allow for multiple ids per query by removing object_id. (In
    implementation if one wants to specify an object_id, they should
    combine it with object_key, but this happens outside of the scope
    of the compiler.)

    with the streaming enhancement to see no status if the http

    Modeled on patch supplied by Tony Manhollan.
    Ticket #67.
  * Added some additional checking to the http transaction flow in an attempt
    to masquerade networking issues as 503 (service unavailable) erorrs when
    libCURL returns a zero status to us.
    Ticket #69.
  * Revised http logging methodology for SWIG bound languages and
    updated developer documentation accordingly. For all SWIG languages,
    RetsSession::SetHttpLogName("log.name") is all that is needed to 
    invoke http logging. Legacy usage is still supported.
  * Revised Librets-Version header to be "X-Librets-Version".
  * libCURL requirement updated to 7.18.2 to avoid some bugs in curl

Version 1.2.1 - 25 Jun 2008

  * Add Rets 1.7 support.
    Ticket #39.

    Ticket #52.
  * Add PHP interface.  (And added PHP to the windows binary build.)
    Ticket #51.
  * Add JAVA interface. On Unixen, you need to include --with-java-prefix and
    point it to the JDK as in --with-java-prefix=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0.
    Ticket #53.

Version 1.2.0 - 9 May 2008

  * Add "streaming" enhancement. This enhancement improves performance
    for larger fetches at expense of risking timeouts with the RETS server.
    This enhancement moves a significant portion of the search and retrieval
    logic into the SearchResultSet logic. As a result, when the SearchResultSet
    is first returned, it may not have retrieved any data from the RETS server.
    You can only be assured that at least one row has been retrieved by
    calling SearchResultSet::HasNext().
    Ticket #41.

Version 1.1.12 - 6 May 2008

  * Extend XML parsing for metadata to include ISO characters if specified.
    Ticket #54.

Version 1.1.11 - 1 Apr 2008

    Ticket #36.
  * Expose SqlToDmqlCompiler to C#.
    Ticket #42.
  * Handle changes to curl-config in curl 7.17.x and later.
    Ticket #46.
  * Add MetadataTable::GetMinimumAsString() and GetMaximumAsString().
    Ticket #47.
  * Remove std_string.i and std_vector.i from swig to allow for
    default versions to be used.
    Ticket #49.
  * SqlToDmqlCompiler now accepts a ? as a value in a WHERE clause.
    Ticket #48  Not complete, as you cannot yet take action on that.

    fail. Ticket #40.

    was sent by the server. Ticket #43.

  * For the languages supported by swig: map MetadataObject

Version 1.1.7 - 13 February 2007

  * The SQL to DMQL compiler (and its ANTLR dependency) are now
    optional.  This should only effect people using C++ and this
    functionality.
  * Fix some build problems on OS X/Unix where ANTLR wasn't where we
    were expecting it.
